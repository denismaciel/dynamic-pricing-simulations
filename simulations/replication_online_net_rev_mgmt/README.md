## Run simluations

```
python3 simulations/replication_online_net_rev_mgmt/sim.py simulate --n-periods 100,500,10000,50000,10000
```
Depending on your machine, this step can take a long time. It took about 4 hours on my Thinkpad X1 Carbon with an i7 processor.

## Convert pickle files from the simulation to CSVs
